# Userscripts for the WEB
These should be used with something like tampermonkey. The arrows are to toggle previews.

## Mangaupdates

### [Cover Previewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Reibies/WEB_Userscripts/master/Mangaupdates/MU_hover_cover.user.js)
<details>
<summary>Uses the official API so it's faster and better than the older versions of this but it's bare bones so no options (yet)</summary>

</details>

### [GridView](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Reibies/WEB_Userscripts/refs/heads/master/Mangaupdates/MU_GridView.user.js)
<details>
<summary>Allows you to view a more modern(2005) version of mangaupdates! Your lists will have covers and all the same functionality.</summary>

- Version 3.0! Finally working(?)
- RECOMENDATION: Set all your lists to `Show (under 100) per page` It's not necessary but obviously a grid is longer and more laggy than a list 
- You can update, change score, and move all via the API
- Clicking the bottom area areound the title acts as the checkbox/select the orange border means it's selected
- Clicking the upper left or right areas expand input for score and current read
- Native MU variables were used for the colors so if you have css that changes things try and ovveride those

## Misc
### [FauxShishi](https://github.com/Reibies/WEB_Userscripts/raw/refs/heads/master/MISC/FauxShiShi.user.js)
<details>
<summary>Lets you simulate real paper scans on—currently—mangadex</summary>

**Modes**
- Senka: greyish and faded manga stock
- Shimbun: Japanese newsprint stock
- e-ink: (bad right now since I don't have an e-reader to cross refrence)
- Newsprint: Old Sunday funnies style, it leans salmonish and the paper grain is more horizontally coarse and chromatic
- Denoise: just ups the contrast a bit
- "Filter:" is what you alter for the tinting and contrast effects if you feel like it's subpar on your screen (My tip is you can stack and re-order filters)
- This used to be a userstyle that I converted to JS for convenience so this is probably a sub-par way of handling it.
